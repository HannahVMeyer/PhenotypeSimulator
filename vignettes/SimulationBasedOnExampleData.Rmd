*PhenotypeSimulator* allows for the simulation of high-dimensional phenotypes
comprised from a number of different components: genetic variant and population-
genetic effects, non-genetic covariates, correlated and observational noise 
effects. In this vignette, we show the usefulness of being able to specify
different phenotype components with distinct properties. We demonstrate how 
different phenotype components relate directly to a real high-dimensional, 
image-derived data set of cardiac morphology. 

Figure \ref{fig:wallthickness} shows the average left ventricular wall thickness 
of 1,185 healthy volunteers measured at more than 27,000 positions in the left 
ventricle of the heart @deMarvao2014 @Biffi2017. 


```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="\\label{fig:wallthickness}**Left ventricular wall thickness and contributing factors.** Left ventricular wall thickness was measured at more than 27k positions in a cohort of 1,185 healthy volunteers. The average wall thickness at each position is depicted in saturated colours (the mesh depicts the right ventricle for reference). Heart wall thickness is determined by an interplay of genetic (green arrows) and non-genetic factors (grey arrows). Additional correlation between positional thickness can be observed for measures in close spatial proximity.", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(system.file("extdata/vignettes/wallthickness-min.png",
                                    package = "PhenotypeSimulator"))
```


These cardiac morphology measurements are likely 
shaped by a combination of direct genetic variant effects, population genetic 
effects and non-genetic covariates. In addition, other influences like image 
acquisition and processing can contribute to the final measurements - these 
effects are summarised as observational noise. Furthermore, by the nature of the 
measurements i.e. wall thickness of an approximately smooth ventricular wall, 
measurements in close spatial proximity will be strongly correlated. 


The following sections will show the distribution of additional cohort 
measurements like height and age (non-genetic covariates) and the correlation
of the measurements by proximity. In analogy to those, similar components will
then be simulated with *PhenotypeSimulator*.

## Cardiac morphology data
The following section depicts data from 100 randomly selected participants of 
the 1,185 healthy volunteers of the original study. From the 27k heart wall 
thickness measurements, a subset of 1,000 measurements ie. phenotypes was chosen
to depict the correlation pattern. 


```{r load real data}
library(PhenotypeSimulator)
library(ggplot2)

phenofile <- system.file("extdata/vignettes/pheno_small.rds", 
                            package = "PhenotypeSimulator")
covsfile <- system.file("extdata/vignettes/covs.rds", 
                            package = "PhenotypeSimulator")

pheno <- readRDS(phenofile)
covs <- readRDS(covsfile)

dim(pheno)
dim(covs)
colnames(covs)
```

As example covariates of the dataset, age, height, weights, sex and the number 
slices in the 2D cardiac MRI were chosen (see original publication for details 
on phenotypes @deMarvao2014). Figure \ref{fig:distribution_covs} shows the 
distribution of these covariates across the 100 individuals. 

```{r distribution, fig.cap="\\label{fig:distribution_covs}**Distribution of covariates.** Histograms of the reduced cohort data (100 individuals) for sex, age, height, weight and number of 2D cardiac MRI slices.", fig.align='center'}
covs_melt <- reshape2::melt(covs, value.name="meassure", 
                            variable.name="covariate")
covs_melt$covariate <- factor(covs_melt$covariate,
                              levels=c("Age", "Height", "Weight", "Sex", 
                                       "Slices"),
                              labels= c("Age [years]", "Height [cm]", 
                                        "Weight [kg]", "Sex", "Slices"))
p_cont <- ggplot(dplyr::filter(covs_melt, covariate %in% c("Age [years]", 
                                                           "Height [cm]", 
                                                           "Weight [kg]")), 
                   aes(x=meassure))
p_cont <- p_cont + geom_histogram(binwidth=1) +
    facet_wrap(~covariate, scales = "free") +
    theme_bw() +
    theme(axis.title.x=element_blank(),
          strip.background = element_rect(fill="white", color="black"))

p_cat <- ggplot(dplyr::filter(covs_melt, covariate %in% c("Sex", "Slices")), 
                   aes(x=meassure))
p_cat <- p_cat + geom_bar(aes(x=meassure)) +
    facet_wrap(~covariate, scales = "free") +
    theme_bw() +
    theme(axis.title.x=element_blank(),
          strip.background = element_rect(fill="white", color="black"))

combine <- cowplot::plot_grid(p_cont, p_cat, nrow=2) 
print(combine)
```

The correlation of the 1,000 left-ventricular wall thickness measurements is 
shown in Figure \ref{fig:corpheno}. While we don't know the exact influences of
each covariate, the genetic effects or the observational noise, we can clearly 
see that there is spatial correlation effect, where positions in proximity 
(close to the diagonal) in general are more correlated than more distant 
positions.

```{r correlation phenotypes, eval=FALSE}
cor_pheno <- cor(pheno)
gplots::heatmap.2(cor_pheno, trace="none", dendrogram="none", keysize=1,
                  col=colorRampPalette(c("white", "#5BBCD6")),
                  labRow=FALSE, labCol=FALSE,
                  breaks=seq(0,1,0.001),
                  key.title="",
                  key.xlab="Pearson's correlation coefficient",
                  key.ylab="",
                  density.info="none")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='\\textwidth', fig.align='center',fig.cap="\\label{fig:corpheno}\\textbf{Correlation of left ventricular wall thickness measurements.}"}
cor_pheno <- cor(pheno)
knitr::include_graphics(system.file("extdata/vignettes/cor_pheno-min.png",
            package = "PhenotypeSimulator"))
```

## Simulation
For the simulation of similar phenotype components as shown above, we 
make the assumption that the above distributions approximate a uniform (age),
normal (weight, height) and binomial (sex) distribution. The slices are assumed
to be uniformly drawn from four categories. In the following, we extract 
the relevant distribution parameters: mean and standard deviation for normal 
distribution, range for uniform distribution, and proportion of ones from 
binomial distribution. To approximate the spatial correlation, we get the 0.999 
quantile of the correlation values.

```{r data parameters }
age_range <- range(covs$Age)

weight_mean <- mean(covs$Weight)
weight_sd <- sd(covs$Weight)

height_mean <- mean(covs$Height)
height_sd <- sd(covs$Height)

slices_categories <- length(unique(covs$Slices))

sex_proportion_male <- length(which(covs$Sex==1))/nrow(covs)

correlation <- quantile(unlist(cor_pheno[lower.tri(cor_pheno)]), 0.999)
```

We use these distribution parameters to simulate non-genetic covariate effects 
with *PhenotypeSimulator::noiseFixedEffects*. For the simulation of the spatial 
correlation effect, we use the above quantile cut-off for the construction of 
the correlation matrix with *PhenotypeSimulator::correlatedBgEffects*.

```{r simulate data}
set.seed(25)
covs_simulated <- noiseFixedEffects(N=100, P=1000, NrFixedEffects = 5, 
                                    NrConfounders = 1,
                  distConfounders = c("unif", "norm", "norm", "cat_unif", "bin"),
                  mConfounders = c(mean(age_range), weight_mean, height_mean),
                  sdConfounders = c(age_range[2] -mean(age_range), weight_sd, 
                                    height_sd),
                  probConfounders = sex_proportion_male,
                  catConfounders = slices_categories)

background_simulated <- correlatedBgEffects(N=100, P=1000, pcorr=correlation)

```

Figure \ref{fig:distribution_simulated} and \ref{fig:corsimulated} show the 
simulated covariates and spatial correlation based 
on the parameters from the real data. While the distributions are not a perfect 
replication (as expected with small sample sizes and our initial assumptions 
about the true underlying distributions of the covariates), they will serve as 
good approximations for simulating similar datasets as the one we based the 
simulations on.
