## <i class="fa fa-cubes" aria-hidden="true"></i> PhenotypeSimulator

**PhenotypeSimulator** allows for the flexible simulation of phenotypes from
different genetic and non-genetic (noise) components. 

In quantitative genetics, genotype to phenotype mapping is commonly realised by
fitting a linear model to the genotype as the explanatory variable and the
phenotype as the response variable. Other explanatory variable such as
additional sample measures (e.g. age, height, weight) or batch effects can also
be included. For linear mixed models, in addition to the fixed effects of the
genotype and the covariates, different random effect components can be included,
accounting for population structure in the study cohort or environmental
effects. The application of linear and linear mixed models in quantitative
genetics ranges from genetic studies in model organism such as yeast and
*Arabidopsis thaliana* to human molecular, morphological or imaging derived
traits. Developing new methods for increasing numbers of sample cohorts,
phenotypic measurements or complexity of phenotypes to analyse, often requires
the simulation of datasets with a specific underlying phenotype structure. 

**PhenotypeSimulator** allows for the simulation of complex phenotypes under
different models, including genetic variant effects and infinitesimal genetic
effects (reflecting population structure) as well as correlated, non-genetic
covariates and observational noise effects. Different phenotypic effects can be
combined into a final phenotype while controlling for the proportion of variance
explained by each of the components. For each component, the number of
variables, their distribution and the design of their effect across traits can
be customised.
